However, what I'm looking for is the best app for 'picking and choosing' routes I can select from and sync with my Wahoo to GPS.

Hi amp#x200B; I am planning a quite long distance bike ride this Summer. I want to start off with something quite simple, which is to go from Coventry to the Peak District, about 65 miles I think, over 2 days. amp#x200B; Anyone have any recommendations on how to plan this?

When I ask OSM for bicycle directions close to my home I often see mistakes. That is, I know that it's faster (and safe) to go another way at some places than I'm told to go. This makes me less confident in the directions I'm given in other places, where I'm less familiar too. I'm sure many people have stopped using OSM and gone to Google Maps because of this, which is terrible IMO (I've also tested GM vs OSM on one stretch, and found OSM to be better, but still, this is important) So I really.

Hi All, Sorry if this is a daft question (or if it's been asked before), but I've only really gotten into (city) running since I've been living abroad for a few years. In a few weeks, I'll be moving back to the deep Suffolk countryside and there's just no way I can run \~10km distances on country lanes - I'd rather take my chances rolling an ankle in a field than meeting a car on a blind bend at 60mph. However, after trying to plan a route on Strava, I see there are no real footpath options. Jump to: Share your current view of the map!

Hey there, i couldn't find what i was looking for so i thought i would ask here if anyone knows something that might help me find it: i'm hiking a lot and am looking for a map to display all my (.gpx) hiking routes - in one map. i want this map only for myself, i don't plan to "share" it or whatever ;) if possible some kind of colouring for the tracks would be nice. i plan to use it as decoration for my flat by either having it printed out or getting a coloured e-ink-display and just display.

However, when trying to make some I found some anomalies in the routes and I wasn't clear how to map them, ideas/thoughts welcome.

For example, the route may run along the main road but deviate This blog post gives an overview of how to perform route planning 🏃 🚲 🚗 with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.
